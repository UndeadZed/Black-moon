# Autonomous Car project using CARLA

this project is for generating a model of an autonomous car in a CARLA's simulation using machine learning and neural networks

# Motivation

this project is to learn more about automation, simulation and neural networks and autonomous cars in general as CARLA's simulation is more realistic and has more to offer than that of Udacity

# Requirements

there are currently no requiremnts as the project is still in development
