# Autonomous Car project


this project is for generating a model of an autonomous car in a Udacity's car simulation using convolutional neural networks


# Motivation

I honestly started this project because I was bored and I had nothing better to do

# Requirements

for this version you need to install the [udacity/self-driving-sim](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) it is also recommended that you install version 2 since it is the version that I have used for this project

it is also very important that you have all the required libraries and that you install the simulation in the same directory as the code file

# Credits

this model is based on Nvidia's End-to-End Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars which you can check from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

this was also inspired by [Murtaza Hassan's](https://github.com/murtazahassan) project on the same topic
